Currently, I am working as a Lecturer at Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology <a href="https://www.cuet.ac.bd/">(CUET)</a>. My primary research interest lies in the area of Natural Language Processing; particularly, I am enthusiastic about Multilingual and Multimodal NLP research. I am interested in exploring how existing resources of resource-rich languages can be effectively utilized to develop multilingual tools focusing on improving efficiency for low/zero-resource languages. I am also excited about problems like how we can build models that can efficiently fuse and meaningfully share features between multiple modalities (i.e. linguistic, acoustic, visual)? Because to enable seamless interaction between intelligent machines and humans, it is crucial to process, relate, and combine information from several modalities.
